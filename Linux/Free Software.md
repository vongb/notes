# Free Software
There are two types of *freedoms* when it comes to software: **gratis** (free beer) or **libre** (free speech).

## Free as in beer (gratis)
Definition: **gratis** - *adverb*, without charge; free.

This phrase refers to software not costing any money however the user is **not** free to view source code, improve, or change the software. That right is exclusive to the maker of the software.

An example would be Adobe Flash Player; it is free to obtain a copy but we cannot change the software. Adobe holds the control over the software.

## Free as in speech (libre)
This means free to use, view and change source code, and/or distribute the software.
