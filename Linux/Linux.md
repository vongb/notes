# Linux

## PATH variable
An **environment variable** that contains an ordered list of paths that LInux will **search for executables** when running a command. 

This means we can `echo "Hello world"` instead of `/bin/echo "Hello world"`.

Linux will traverse the **colon separated** paths in order, executing the first matching executable, in the paths list.

## What is the Shell?
A program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform.
